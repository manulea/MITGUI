This software was created by students at the Otago Polytechnic for our Project 1 & 2 papers in the BIT degree. It is a prototype demo of software that has the potential to allow physically impaired individuals to use a personal computer via facial gestures.

For example they could map a keystroke to the "open mouth" gesture. This would mean that while running the software, they could open their mouth and the keystroke of their choosing would be sent to the computer by the software, rather than by the keyboard.

# Installation instructions

Once the command prompt is open, click anywhere in the black box to type these commands in to:

1. mkdir fr
2. cd fr
3. git clone https://github.com/manulea/MITGUI

If the commands are successful you should beable to see "Cloning into 'MITGUI'" in your command prompt.

You can now close this window.

8. Wait until you are back at <base> C:\Users\user>_ 

You are now ready to run the Face Recognition software.

### 4. Running the software

Using the Anaconda prompt, follow these instructions:

1. Type: "cd fr" without the quotation marks, then press the Enter key on your keyboard.
2. Type: "cd MITGUI" without the quotation marks, then press the Enter key on your keyboard.
3. You should now be in <base> C:\Users\user\fr\MITGUI> 
4. Type "pip install pipenv" without the quotation marks, then press Enter key on your keyboard.
5. Wait until you see Successfully installed pipenv-2018.11.26
6. Run pipenv shell by typing: "pipenv shell" in to the command prompt without the quotation marks, then send the instruction to the computer by pressing the Enter key on your keyboard.
7. You should now be in the virtual environment if you see <MITGUI-*****> <base> C:\Users\user\fr\MITGUI>
8. Type: "pipenv sync" without the quotation marks, then press Enter key on your keyboard.
9. This will take a while.
10. Type: "python fr.py" in to the command prompt without the quotation marks, then press Enter on your keyboard.
